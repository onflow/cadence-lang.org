# Protocol Smart Contracts in Cadence 1.0

In 2024, the network will be upgrading to Cadence 1.0. 
In addition to many changes to the Cadence programming language and
the Cadence token standards, the flow protocol smart contracts
are also being updated to be compatible with the changes.

All applications and smart contracts that interact with these contracts
will need to update their transactions and scripts in order to be compatible with the changes.

# Important Info

We are assuming that you are somewhat familiar with
[the Cadence 1.0 changes](https://forum.flow.com/t/update-on-cadence-1-0/5197)
and the changes to the fungible token standard for this document. Please
read those guides if you are curious about those changes.

The updated code for the Cadence 1.0 versions of the protocol smart contracts
is locaed in the [`stable-cadence` branch of the flow-core-contracts repo](https://github.com/onflow/flow-core-contracts/pull/319).
Please look at the changes there to understand how the contracts have changed.
Every contract in the repo is changing.

In the latest version of the emulator, here are the import addresses
for all of the important contracts related to the protocol:
