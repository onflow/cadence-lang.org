# Fungible Tokens in Cadence 1.0

In 2024, the network will be upgrading to Cadence 1.0. 
In addition to many changes to the Cadence programming language,
the Cadence token standards are also being streamlined and improved.
All applications will need to prepare and migrate their existing
Cadence smart contracts, scripts, and transactions for the update.
If you do not update your code, your applications will become non-functional
after the network upgrade.

This document describes the changes to the Cadence Fungible Token (FT) standard and
gives a step-by-step guide for how to upgrade your FT contract from Cadence 0.42
to Cadence 1.0.

We'll be using the [`ExampleToken` contract](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft/blob/v2-standard/contracts/ExampleToken.cdc)
as an example. Many projects have used `ExampleToken` as a starting point for their projects,
so it is widely applicable to most NFT developers on Flow.
The upgrades required for `ExampleToken` will cover 90%+ of what you'll 
need to do to update your contract. Each project most likely has
additional logic or features that aren't included in `ExampleToken`,
but hopefully after reading this guide, you'll understand Cadence 1.0
well enough that you can easily make any other changes that are necessary.

As always, there are plenty of people on the Flow team and in the community 
who are happy to help answer any questions you may have, so please reach out
in Discord if you need any help.

# Important Info

Please read [the FLIP](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/55)
that describes the changes to the `FungibleToken` standard first.

The updated code for the V2 Fungible Token standard is located in the
[`v2-standard` branch of the flow-ft repo](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft/pull/131).
Please look at the changes there to understand how the standard and examples have changed.
This branch also includes the updated versions of `FungibleTokenMetadataViews`,
`Burner`, `FungibleTokenSwitchboard`, and `TokenForwarding`.

In the latest version of the emulator, here are the import addresses
for all of the important contracts related to fungible tokens:

| Contract                    | Emulator Import Address |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `FungibleToken`             | `0xee82856bf20e2aa6`    |
| `ViewResolver`              | `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`    |
| `Burner`                    | `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`    |
| `MetadataViews`             | `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`    |
| `FungibleTokenMetadataViews`| `0xee82856bf20e2aa6`    |
| `FungibleTokenSwitchboard`  | `0xee82856bf20e2aa6`    |

See the other guides in this section of the docs for the import
addresses of other important contracts in the emulator.
