## Fixed-point numbers

:::warning[ðŸš§ Status]

Currently only the 64-bit wide `Fix64` and `UFix64` types are available. More fixed-point number types will be added in a future release.

:::

Fixed-point numbers are useful for representing fractional values. They have a fixed number of digits after a decimal point.

They are essentially integers which are scaled by a factor. For example, the value 1.23 can be represented as 1230 with a scaling factor of 1/1000. The scaling factor is the same for all values of the same type and stays the same during calculations.

Fixed-point numbers in Cadence have a scaling factor with a power of 10, instead of a power of 2 (i.e., they are decimal, not binary).

Signed fixed-point number types have the prefix `Fix`, have the following factors, and can represent values in the following ranges:

- **`Fix64`**: Factor 1/100,000,000; -92233720368.54775808 through 92233720368.54775807

Unsigned fixed-point number types have the prefix `UFix`, have the following factors, and can represent values in the following ranges:

- **`UFix64`**: Factor 1/100,000,000; 0.0 through 184467440737.09551615

### Fixed-point number functions

Fixed-Point numbers have multiple built-in functions you can use:

-
    ```cadence
    view fun toString(): String
    ```

    Returns the string representation of the fixed-point number.

    ```cadence
    let fix = 1.23

    fix.toString()  // is "1.23000000"
    ```
-
    ```cadence
    view fun toBigEndianBytes(): [UInt8]
    ```

    Returns the byte array representation (`[UInt8]`) in big-endian order of the fixed-point number.

    ```cadence
    let fix = 1.23

    fix.toBigEndianBytes()  // is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 84, 212, 192]`
    ```

All fixed-point types support the following functions:

-
    ```cadence
    view fun T.fromString(_ input: String): T?
    ```

    Attempts to parse a fixed-point value from a base-10 encoded string, returning `nil` if the string is invalid.

    For a given fixed-point numeral `n` of type `T`, `T.fromString(n.toString())` is equivalent to wrapping `n` up in an `optional`.

    Strings are invalid if:

      - they contain non-digit characters.
      - they don't fit in the target type.
      - they're missing a decimal or fractional component. For example, both `0.` and `.1` are invalid strings, but `0.1` is accepted.

    For signed types like `Fix64`, the string may optionally begin with a `+` or `-` sign prefix.

    For unsigned types like `UFix64`, sign prefices are not allowed.

    Examples:

    ```cadence
    let nil1: UFix64? = UFix64.fromString("0.") // nil, fractional part is required

    let nil2: UFix64? = UFix64.fromString(".1") // nil, decimal part is required

    let smol: UFix64? = UFix64.fromString("0.1") // ok

    let smolString: String = "-0.1"

    let nil3: UFix64? = UFix64.fromString(smolString) // nil, unsigned types don't allow a sign prefix

    let smolFix64: Fix64? = Fix64.fromString(smolString) // ok
    ```

-
    ```cadence
    view fun T.fromBigEndianBytes(_ bytes: [UInt8]): T?
    ```
    Attempts to parse an integer value from a byte array representation (`[UInt8]`) in big-endian order, returning `nil` if the input bytes are invalid.

    For a given integer `n` of type `T`, `T.fromBigEndianBytes(n.toBigEndianBytes())` is equivalent to wrapping `n` up in an [optional].

    The bytes are invalid if:

      - the length of the bytes array exceeds the number of bytes needed for the target type.
      - they don't fit in the target type.

    Examples:

    ```cadence
    let fortyTwo: UFix64? = UFix64.fromBigEndianBytes([0, 0, 0, 0, 250, 86, 234, 0]) // ok, 42.0

    let nilWord: UFix64? = UFix64.fromBigEndianBytes("[100, 22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]") // nil, out of bounds

    let nilWord2: Fix64? = Fix64.fromBigEndianBytes("[0, 22, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]") // // nil, size (9) exceeds number of bytes needed for Fix64 (8)

    let negativeNumber: Fix64? = Fix64.fromBigEndianBytes([255, 255, 255, 255, 250, 10, 31, 0]) // ok, -1
    ```

## Number type casting

Casting between number types (e.g. `Int` to `UInt`, `Fix64` to `Int`) using the [casting operators] (`as`, `as?` and `as!`) is not supported.

To convert between number types, the conversion functions ((e.g. `UInt(_)`)) must be used. These conversion functions have the same name as the desired type.

```cadence
let value: UInt8 = 1

let intValue: Int? = value as? Int 
// intValue is `nil` and has type `Int?`

let validInt: Int = Int(value)
// validInt is `1` and has type `Int`
```

When casting from a larger number type to a smaller one (narrowing), the cast will succeed if the value can be represented in the smaller type. If it cannot an error will be thrown indicating overflow or underflow. Casting to a larger number type will always succeed.

```cadence
let intValue: Int16 = 256

let uintValue: UInt8 = UInt8(intValue)
// error: overflow, UInt8 has max value of `255`

let validUInt: UInt16 = UInt16(intValue)
// validUInt is `256` and has type `UInt16`

let largerIntValue: Int = Int(intValue)
// largerIntValue is `256` and has type `Int`
```

Casting from integer types to fixed point types and vice versa is supported by calling the conversion functions as well. The same conditions as narrowing applies, an error will be thrown if the value cannot be represented in the range.

```cadence
let intValue: Int = -1

let fixValue: Fix64 = Fix64(intValue)
// fixValue is `-1.00000000` and has type `Fix64`

let ufixValue: UFix64 = UFix64(intValue)
// error: underflow, UFix64 has min value `0.0`
```
