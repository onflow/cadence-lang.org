# Cadence Language Documentation

> Cadence is a resource-oriented programming language designed for smart contract development on Flow. It introduces new features that help developers ensure their code is safe, secure, clear, and approachable.
>
> **Resource-Oriented Programming**: Cadence pairs linear types with object capabilities to create a secure and declarative model for digital ownership. Resources ensure that assets can only exist in one location at a time, cannot be copied, and cannot be accidentally lost or deleted.
>
> **Key Features**:
> - **Type Safety**: Strong static type system that prevents important classes of erroneous behavior at compile-time
> - **Resource Safety**: Resources are enforced by the runtime, ensuring assets cannot be duplicated or lost
> - **Design by Contract**: Built-in pre-conditions and post-conditions for functions and transactions
> - **Capability-Based Security**: Access control enforced by the type system, restricting access to only authorized parties
> - **128-bit Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Financial precision for currency and asset operations
> - **Contract Upgradability**: Built-in support for contract updates while maintaining data integrity
>
> Cadence's syntax is inspired by modern languages like Swift, Kotlin, and TypeScript, making it familiar to developers while introducing powerful new paradigms for smart contract development.

This document offers comprehensive resources for learning and developing with Cadence.
