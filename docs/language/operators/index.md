Operators are special symbols that perform a computation for one or more values. They are either unary, binary, or ternary:

- Unary operators perform an operation for a single value. The unary operator symbol appears before the value.
- Binary operators operate on two values. The binary operator symbol appears between the two values (infix).
- Ternary operators operate on three values. The first operator symbol appears between the first and second value, and the second operator symbol appears between the second and third value (infix).

See the following articles to learn more about the various types of operators:

- [Assignment, Move, Force-Assignment, and Swapping Operators]
- [Arithmetic and Logical Operators]
- [Comparison Operators]
- [Bitwise and Ternary Conditional Operators]
- [Casting Operators]
- [Optional Operators]
- [Prescedence and Associativity]
