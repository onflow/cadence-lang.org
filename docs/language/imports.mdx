Programs can import declarations (types, functions, variables, and so on) from other programs.

## Importing contracts

Imports are declared using the `import` keyword. You can import your contracts using **one** of the following three options:

1. Import your contracts by name, which you must use if you're using the [Flow CLI]. For example:

   ```cadence
   import "HelloWorld"
   ```

   This will automatically import the contract, based on the configuration found `flow.json`. It will automatically handle address changes between mainnet, testnet, and emulator, as long as those are present in `flow.json`.

1. Import your contracts by an address, which imports all declarations. Both [Flow playground] and [Flow runner] require importing by address.

1. Import your contracts by the names of the declarations that should be imported, followed by the `from` keyword, and then followed by the address.

   - If importing a local file, the location is a string literal, as well as the path to the file. Deployment of code with file imports requires usage of the [Flow CLI].
   - If importing an external type in a different account, the location is an address literal, as well as the address of the account where the declarations are deployed to and published.

   ```cadence
   // Import the type `Counter` from a local file.
   //
   import Counter from "./examples/counter.cdc"

   // Import the type `Counter` from an external account.
   //
   import Counter from 0x299F20A29311B9248F12
   ```
